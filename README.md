# Parts Seekr

Parts Seekr is a lightweight MVP that lets users upload (or capture) a product photo, runs a visual search through a provider API, and returns a price-sorted grid of matching purchase options.

## Local setup

1) Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

2) Configure environment variables
```
cp .env.example .env
```

3) Set up the database
```
npm run prisma:generate
npm run prisma:migrate
```

4) Start the dev server
```
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Provider configuration

Parts Seekr uses a provider adapter so you can swap product search APIs.

- `DATABASE_URL=...` (Postgres connection string)
- `PROVIDER_IDS=ebay,amazon,aliexpress`
- `EBAY_CLIENT_ID=...`
- `EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET=...`
- `EBAY_MARKETPLACE_ID=EBAY_MOTOR`
- `AMAZON_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...`
- `AMAZON_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...`
- `AMAZON_PARTNER_TAG=...`
- `AMAZON_HOST=webservices.amazon.com`
- `AMAZON_REGION=us-east-1`
- `ALIEXPRESS_APP_KEY=...`
- `ALIEXPRESS_APP_SECRET=...`
- `ALIEXPRESS_TRACK_ID=...`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GAM_AD_UNIT_PATH=` (for Google Ad Manager, e.g. `/1234567/parts-seekr`)
- `CAP_SERVER_URL=` (required for Capacitor apps; use your deployed HTTPS URL)
- `DEMO_MODE=true` (optional)
- `SUPABASE_URL=...` (for uploads)
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...` (server-only)
- `SUPABASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=torque-autopart-uploads`

Providers include eBay Motors, Amazon, and AliExpress. If credentials are missing, searches will return empty results for those providers.

### Google Ad Manager setup

Ad slots render through Google Publisher Tag (GPT) when `NEXT_PUBLIC_GAM_AD_UNIT_PATH` is set.
The app accepts either `/1234567/parts-seekr` or `1234567/parts-seekr` and normalizes it at runtime.

Configured placements in this app:
- `home-hero-banner`
- `home-upload-inline`
- `home-mid-banner`
- `results-top-banner`
- `results-inline-banner`
- `results-bottom-banner`

Example ad unit path resolution:
- Base: `/1234567/parts-seekr`
- Slot path generated in app: `/1234567/parts-seekr/results-top-banner`

To enable live banners in a deployment:
1) Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_GAM_AD_UNIT_PATH` in the deployment environment
2) Redeploy the app so the public env var is compiled into the client bundle
3) Create matching GAM ad units for each placement listed above
4) Publish line items/creatives in Google Ad Manager

If GAM has no fill for a slot, the app now collapses the empty div in production instead of showing a placeholder label.

## Mobile app setup (Capacitor)

This project uses server APIs, so mobile builds should load the deployed web app URL (not a static export).

1) Set `CAP_SERVER_URL` in `.env` to your deployed app (for example, `https://app.partsseekr.com`)
2) Generate native projects:
```
npm run cap:add:android
npm run cap:add:ios
```
3) Sync web/native config after changes:
```
npm run cap:sync
```
4) Open in native IDEs:
```
npm run cap:open:android
npm run cap:open:ios
```

## How it works

1) Upload image → stored in `public/uploads` (MVP)
2) Hash image → check 24h cache
3) Visual search provider → candidates
4) Normalize + dedupe → stable sort by total price
5) Persist results + display in grid with ad slots after every 8 cards

## Known limitations

- Exact matching is probabilistic; different lighting or angles may reduce match accuracy.
- Visual search providers vary in coverage and price accuracy.
- File storage is local for MVP and not durable across serverless deployments.
- Rate limiting is in-memory only.
- Demo mode can insert sample results when no matches are returned.

## Next improvements

- Add affiliate tracking links and additional providers (Bing, Amazon, eBay).
- Improve dedupe with product identifiers and stronger similarity matching.
- Move uploads to object storage (S3, GCS).
- Add SSR caching and background refresh for stale results.

## Minimal test plan

- Upload valid JPG/PNG/WebP below 8MB and verify results populate.
- Upload unsupported file type and confirm validation errors.
- Upload same image twice within 24h and confirm cache reuse.
- Verify sorting by Cheapest / Most expensive / Best match is stable.
- Verify ad slots appear after every 8 results without breaking the grid.
